MAGALLANES
==========

- What's Magallanes?
    Magallanes is a deployment tool for PHP applications; it's quite simple to use and manage.

- What can it do?
    You can deploy your code to all the servers you want (via rsync over ssh),
    and run tasks for that code.

- Can you give me some examples/ideas?
    Sure!
    Supouse you have a checkout of your app and you have to deploy it to four servers;
    and after each deploy you have to run some tasks, like fixing file permissions,
    creating symlinks, etc. You can define all this on Magallanes and with just
    one command you can do all this at once!
    Like this: $ mage deploy to:production

- What's this sorcery?!
    Easy boy. It's not sorcery, just some technomagick!
    In Magallanes you define environments like "production" on the example above.
    Then, on that environment configuration, you set up to which hosts you want to deploy,
    and what tasks to run (after, on, before deploying).

- And what spells... TASKS! What tasks has it built in?
    Just a few...
        * deployment/rsync  - This task is for deploying your code to the remote servers.
        * scm/update        - This task is for updating (git/svn) your base wokring copy.

    But! you can create your own taks, and execute commands on your working copy,
    and in your deployed code!

- This is awesome! Where can I learn more?
